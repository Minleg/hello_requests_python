Part 3:
Logging vs print

Logging is used for debugging purpose and are meant solely to help the developer debug issues with the program and to 
ensure that the code works as expected.
Print is used for displaying messages to the user. Either to let them know that eveyrthing is working as expected or to let them know that
something is going wrong. It lets the user know in a simple terms so even a non programmer user can understand what's going on with the program.

Sensitive information like values of the API keyss should not be logged as it is private and personal. It should be stored as a environment variable.
